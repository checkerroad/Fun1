The teacher made a riddle in the lesson, the student answers, but incorrectly. The teacher says:
- Wrong. The correct answer is home. But I like the way you think.
It's Vovochka's turn. He asks the teacher:
- Maria Ivanovna, can you guess the answer to my riddle?
The teacher:
- Well, I'm listening to you.
A three-letter word and you pick it up every day?
The teacher:
- Oh, you boor! Get out of the classroom!
To which Vovochka responds:
- I meant chalk. But I like the way you think!
