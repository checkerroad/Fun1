The husband decided to take control of whether his wife is cheating on him or not while he is on a business trip. Before leaving, he says to his wife:
- Take off your underpants, I'll draw a tractor on your pubis. When I come back and the tractor is gone, then you're cheating!
The husband is on a business trip, the wife is walking to the left at full speed. On the last day before my husband's arrival, he looks, there is no tractor. She tells her lover:
- Draw a tractor on my pubis, my husband is coming back tomorrow.
The lover asks:
- Was the tractor working, with smoke?
Wife:
Who the hell knows! Draw a working one, with smoke.
The husband arrives and tells his wife:
- Come to me. Take off your underpants.
The wife took off her panties, shows her husband the tractor, to which the husband tells her:
- You're not sick of tr@hali, even the tractor started up!
