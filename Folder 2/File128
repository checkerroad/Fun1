The teacher in the lesson gave the task to come up with a small verse. The next day, the students tell us who came up with what. It's Vovochka's turn and he's reading:
- There is a statue, in the rays of sunset, with a huge x%em, a shovel in his hands!
The teacher told him:
Vovochka, is it possible somehow without epithets?
Vovochka immediately:
- There is a statue, in the rays of sunset, with a stump of x% I, a shovel in my hands!
The teacher again:
- Vovochka, I asked you not to express yourself, exclude vulgarity from the verse!
Vovochka gives the following option:
- There is a shovel, in the rays of sunset, the statue with x%em has gone somewhere!
