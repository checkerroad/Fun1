Grannies are sitting on a bench at the entrance washing the neighbors' bones.
An SUV pulls up, bratello gets out of it and let's drive at the grandmothers:
- The old ones are sitting down, they are spreading gossip at my entrance in kind!
One of the grannies answers:
- You're evil, you don't respect old age at all. I'll complain to my grandson, he'll arrange it for you!
My brother got really excited:
- What? What other granddaughter? Well, tell him to come here tomorrow at seven for a conversation, explain who he is and what he is.
The next day, the grannies are sitting on the bench again. Jeeps with bratva drive up to the entrance, machine guns and bats in their hands. The yard was cordoned off. Yesterday's brother comes up to Grandma and asks:
- Well, what's the old one, where's your granddaughter?
Granny answers:
- Yes, somewhere here, not far away. Who knows, he's my sniper.
