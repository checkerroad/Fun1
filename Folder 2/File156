A killer walks into a bar, puts a rifle on the table and orders himself a drink. The farmer sitting opposite asks:
- I'm sorry, of course, can I look at my house through the optical sight of a rifle?
The killer responds:
- Yes, look, of course.
The farmer looks at his house and starts to get interested:
- How much do you charge for completing the order? It's just that my wife is at home tumbling with our neighbor!
The killer voices:
- $1000 per shot.
Farmer:
- I'm paying $2000! But shoot off your neighbor's dick, and your wife's head.
The killer takes a rifle, takes a long aim and the farmer fussily tells him:
- Don't hesitate, shoot!
The killer calmly reasons:
"Don't rush me. I'm trying to save you half the money.
