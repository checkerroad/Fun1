A man bought eggs at the market, came home, gave the package to his wife, she looked, and they were all small, dirty. The wife starts yelling, the husband takes the eggs and goes to the bathroom to wash them, so that only the wife calms down. The phone rings, the child picks up the phone. The guy's friend is calling:
- Hi Kolya, is Dad at home?
The child responds:
- Dad is in the bathroom right now, washing eggs!
The friend continues:
- Well, then call your mother to the phone.
Son:
- So mom is in the same place, dad is gnawing on the balls.
