A man in a bank reads a multi-page loan agreement. The manager is tired of waiting for him to read:
- Is everything clear to you under the contract or what is confusing?
Guy:
- Yes, there is such a thing, it is confusing. Section 568, paragraph 126, paragraph 23.
Manager:
- Yes, what is not clear?
Guy:
- A brand with the logo of the bank that issued the loan is burned on the forehead of the borrower with a hot iron.
