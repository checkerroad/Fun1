A soldier has served for 25 years, returns home, and on the way there is a brothel. He's there. He approaches the priestess of love and says:
- I haven't had a woman for 25 years and I don't have any money. Maybe we can come to an agreement somehow?
She tells him:
- If you can throw me ten sticks, I won't take the money, and if not, you'll chop wood for us for half a year.
The soldier happily:
- Agreed!
A soldier climbed on it and the soul rushed to heaven. In order not to lose count, after each stick he makes a chalk mark on the wall. And the priestess of love quietly erases them. A soldier got up after ten sticks and said:
"I've done my job.
She does not agree:
- How did you do it, only seven.
A soldier is looking at the wall and there really are seven crosses. He says:
- Well, then I got lost, now we will complete it.
The prostitute thought, the soldier fucked me so to death, maybe he tells him:
- Have a smoke, I'll pour water on it quickly, I'll break a sweat.
And she ran to her friend and said:
- The soldier fucked me half to death, replace me, I'll take a break for an hour or two.
Meanwhile, in a dark room, a soldier took out a pipe, a flint and a chair and let's strike. At this time, a second prostitute comes to the soldier and runs back screaming:
- I won't serve him!
The first one asks her:
- Why are you so scared?
The second priestess of love tells her:
- He beat you half to death for the @ ball, and now he's sitting and screwing so that sparks fly all over the room!
