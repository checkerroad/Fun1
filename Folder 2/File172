Three women are talking at work. The first one started the topic:
- Listen, girls, yesterday we went to bed with my husband, I accidentally put my hand on his balls, and imagine, they are cold!
The other two got interested for fun, the next day the second friend tells:
- And it's true, we went to bed, I also accidentally put my hand on my balls. Definitely cold!
On the third day they come to work, and the third one sits with blanche under her eye. They ask her,
"What happened?"
The third says:
- Come on with your experiments! Yesterday, my husband and I went to bed, I put my hand on his balls, and they are hot.
Friends:
- So, go on!
Third:
- Well, I expressed a discrepancy.
- Why do all men have cold balls, but you have hot ones?
