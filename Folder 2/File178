The boss gathered all his four employees and said,
"I have to fire one of you!"
The Negro immediately:
- You will not fire me, otherwise it will look like racial discrimination from the outside.
The woman is right there:
- Don't fire me either! It will be like gender-based oppression!
An aged employee:
- If you fire me, I will sue for age discrimination!
And then everyone looked at the young employee. He sighed and said,
"I think I'm a homosexual!"
