The man came to the therapist with a complaint:
- Doctor, I'm afraid I'm losing my wife.
The therapist clarifies:
- Does she not want to see you? Avoiding you?
The man tells:
- Just not! She greets me when I come home from work, my shirts are always clean and ironed, she cooks delicious, the house is always in order. She doesn't mind that I watch football on TV with beer, she never refuses my perverted harassment.
Psychotherapist:
- Well, everything is in perfect order in the rear. What's bothering you?
Man:
- Maybe I'm pushing myself too hard, but when I go to bed and my wife is sure that I'm already asleep, she whispers in my ear every time...
- Well, when are you finally going to die?
