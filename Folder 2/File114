Church service. A drunk man came in and hit the priest in the face, saying:
- They hit you on the cheek, turn the other one. Substitute it!
The priest with a sharp right hook puts the drunk on his ass and says:
- Whatever measure you measure, it will be measured out to you!
And the parishioners surrounded them watching with interest. A policeman approaches:
- Excuse me, what's the matter here? What's happening?
And the crowd to him:
- Don't bother, they're interpreting the Gospel here.
