A seventy-year-old grandfather had a farm. There was a swimming pool in the backyard, and next to it was a small garden with apple trees. One evening, the old man decided to walk around the territory and took a bucket with him to pick apples at the same time. As he approached the pool, he heard cheerful laughter and saw several girls who were swimming in his pool. When they saw him, they went into the water up to their necks. One of the girls shouted:
"We won't get out of the water until you leave!"
The grandfather shows them a bucket and says:
- I didn't come to the pool to stare at young, naked girls. I came here to feed my crocodile.
Like that. Old people can think fast too!
