One woman, despite the fact that her husband earned so-so, did not give her gifts, did not surround her with attention, liked to drink beer with friends, on weekends he was fishing, in the evening after work watching TV, she still treated him warmly. She did not scold, did not reproach, did not demand anything from him, but only took care of him. And although this woman has a real first and last name, a specific residence permit with an address, no one has ever seen her and no married man believes in her existence.
