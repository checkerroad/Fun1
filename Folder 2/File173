A girl comes to the women's clinic and is interested in:
- What to do so that there are no children.
The genicologist tells her:
- There are many ways. Condoms, candles, pills, spirals. After forty-five, you don't have to protect yourself at all.
A few years later, a woman with five children bursts into the office of the same doctor. The doctor, stunned, says:
- Where are you going with a bunch of kids? This is not a kindergarten, but a women's consultation
The woman puts the children in a line and tells him:
- Bullshit all these ways of yours! Please get acquainted!
- This is Valka, a spiral has fallen out!
- This is Anton, the bastard broke!
- This is Svetka, the pill did not work!
- This is Lesechka, a defective candle!
- Well, this is Seryozha... His mother is a fucker who is over forty-five!
