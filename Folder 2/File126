I will put myself in reliable female hands. I'm unpretentious in food, I took a day off to the left, I lift the seat in the toilet, I carry my salary home. I have a passport. All vaccinations are done. I respond to a cat, a Chick, a Hare, etc. I put dirty socks in a specially designated place. The phrase / And mom does it differently!/ I don't use it. Not neutered.
