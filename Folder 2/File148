A guy came to the church and turned to the priest:
- Holy Father, I want to confess!
The priest says:
- I'm listening to you, my son, lighten your soul.
Guy:
A week ago, I helped a friend assemble furniture. They packed it up and I was about to go.. A friend tells me:
- Where are you going in such a downpour? Stay, wait it out.
The guy continues:
- Well, I stayed and eventually fucked her!
- And a couple of days ago, I helped my friend's wife to paste wallpaper. They glued it and it started to rain. She says:
- Wait until the rain stops.
Guy:
- I waited. I fucked her too.
- And yesterday I was helping a friend repair a car in the garage. They fixed it and it started raining...
a friend says:
- Why go somewhere in the rain, stay, let's roll!
Guy:
- Well, we overdid it with alcohol, I fucked a friend too. What should I do, Father?
Father:
- Get the fuck out of here before the rain starts!
