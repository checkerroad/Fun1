A Neanderthal man lived in his cave and one day a woman came to him and said:
- Let me live in your cave.
Neanderthal to her:
- Why do I need you here? The cave is clean, the mammoth is baking on fire...
the woman insists:
- Well, just let me in for one night.
Well, I let him in for one night. The Neanderthal man comes out of the cave the next morning, stretches, looks at his penis and says to him:
"So that's why you're hanging between my legs, leather tail, and I'm choking fish with you!
