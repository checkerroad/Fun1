The exam at the directing faculty of VGIK. The dean asks the students:
- Let's say such a frame. A man and a woman came to visit together. How do you let the audience know that this is a husband and wife?
One student suggests:
She adjusts his tie.
The teacher:
- Or maybe it's his secretary?
Another student:
- He gently hugged her and kisses her.
The teacher:
- Well, it's more like lovers.
The third student:
- He takes a handkerchief out of her purse, blows his nose into it and puts it back in her purse.
The teacher:
- Super! Five balls!
