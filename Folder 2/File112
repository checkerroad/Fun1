The guy and the girl went by train, entered the compartment and when the train started it turned out that there would be no other passengers in the compartment until they arrived at the place. The girl realized right away and says to her boyfriend:
- Let's use the fact that we are alone! Let's have sex!
The guy didn't approve:
- no. We won't do it! I want to marry me, you went out a virgin
Girl thinks:
- The devil made me say that. What will he think of me now?
The guy thinks:
- The devil pulled me, to put on leaky socks today!
