A man walks through a remote forest and sees a girl tied to a tree. All the clothes are torn. He asks:
- What happened?
The girl tells:
- I'm walking through the forest, attacked by some maniacs, tied up, raped.
Guy:
- Did you scream? Was she calling for help?
A girl:
- She called. And no one, not a single living soul!
A man unbuttoning his pants:
- Of course, such a remote place!
