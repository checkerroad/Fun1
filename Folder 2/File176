The hunter was going hunting in the remote taiga, and since the area is not familiar, he took a local guide with him. They walk through the taiga, the guide paves the way with an axe, the hunter with a gun from behind. A bear comes out of the windfall. The guide with the raised axe froze and whispered without turning to the hunter:
- Come here.
Silence. The conductor repeats in a whisper:
- Come here, I say!
Silence again, he wheezed for the third time:
- Come here!
The hunter from behind the tree:
- What the fuck am I calling him?
