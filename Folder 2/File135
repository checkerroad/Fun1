A man and a woman are riding in a compartment. They are conducting a dialogue. The man says:
- I have a feeling that my wife is cheating on me now!
Woman:
- And I have the same feeling that my husband is a cheater.
The man offers:
- Let's take revenge on them!
They took revenge once, the man turned to the wall, sleeping. The woman pushes the man aside and says:
- If I were you, I would take revenge and take revenge!
Man:
- Yes, I'm not vindictive!
