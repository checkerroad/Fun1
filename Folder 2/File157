Professor:

Student:

Professor:
- The next question. How to put a deer in the refrigerator in four steps?
Student:
- I Open the refrigerator, II Pull out the elephant, III Put the deer, IV Close the refrigerator!
Professor:
- That's right again. Next question. It's the King of Beasts' birthday! All the animals came, except one. Who is missing?
Student:
- Deer. Because the deer is still in the fridge!
Professor:
- Excellent answer! Let's move on. Can grandma walk through a swamp with crocodiles?
Student:
- Of course it can! Because all crocodiles walk at the lion's Birthday Party!
Professor:
- Well done! And the last question. Grandma went through the whole swamp, but they found her dead anyway! What happened to her?
The student is not confident:
- Drowned?
Professor:
Not right! A brick that fell out of the plane fell on her! That's it!
