It's the height of summer. An ant is dragging a log. A dragonfly flies by, sexy in a mini bikini. The ant asks:
- Dragonfly, where are you going?
Dragonfly:
- To the pond, I'll sunbathe.
Ant:
- Well, well.
Autumn has come. An ant is dragging a log, a dragonfly in a leather cloak is passing by again, in a hurry. The ant is interested:
- Dragonfly, where are you going?
Dragonfly:
- Yes, it has already become cool, I will fly to the Seychelles, rest, warm up.
Ant:
- Well, well. Come on, come on.
Winter. An ant in felt boots, sawing a log for firewood. A dragonfly flies by, all dressed up. Ant:
- Dragonfly, where are you going now?
Dragonfly:
- To hang out with my friends at the club, there's a literary evening there.
Ant:
- You'll see Krylov, tell him that he's m%dak!
