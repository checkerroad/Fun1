A woman complains to her friends:
- My husband totally fucked me up. He comes home from work, eats borscht and immediately drags me to bed and until the morning, in all poses. Where did you get so much strength from?
One friend advised:
- Tell them that there is not enough money, let them get another job.
My husband got another job. He came home from his second job almost at midnight, very tired. His wife asks him:
- Borscht?
The husband says:
- Yes, what a borscht, I'm very tired, let's go straight to bed!
