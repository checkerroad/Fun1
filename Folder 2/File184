The grandfather and grandmother decided to shake the old days, have sex. The grandmother asks:
- Well, how is it with you, has the warrior risen?
Grandfather:
- No shit! It's not going to work, I've become quite old.
Grandma:
- Well, shake it, pull it, suddenly it will stand up.
My grandfather went behind the stove, returned a couple of minutes later and threw something on my grandmother's bed saying:
- Shake it, pull it!
