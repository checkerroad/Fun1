A masked robber broke into the apartment. Threatening the hostess with violence, he yells:
- She quickly told me where the money is!
Hostess:
- And if I tell you, will you not touch me?
Robber:
- I won't touch it, I promise!
Hostess:
- Swear it!
Robber:
- I swear! I'll be a jerk!
Hostess:
- I keep money in a Savings bank.
