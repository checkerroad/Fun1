At the exam, the student sits down with the professor and says:
- I have a suggestion for you. I did not prepare for the exam, but if you solve my riddle, give me a deuce and I will retake it. Well, if you don't guess, then a five, respectively!
The professor was interested:
- Come on, make a wish!
The student says:
- What is legal but illogical, logical but not legal, what is illegal and not logical.
The professor thought for a long time, but did not guess. I gave the student an excellent score. But he became terribly interested in finding out the answer. The next student sits down with him and the professor says:
- Do you want to solve a riddle instead of an answer for an assessment?
The student tells the professor:
- You don't even have to guess, I'll tell you the answer right away.
- And so, you have a young wife and it's legal but not logical! She has a young lover, it's logical but illegal! A couple of minutes ago, this lover left your exam with an A, this is both illegal and illogical!
