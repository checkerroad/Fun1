A man bought a pack of condoms at a pharmacy, paid for them and let's laugh, walked out of the pharmacy with a laugh. On the second day, the same story. On the third day, he bought it again, laughed, and left. The pharmacist became terribly interested in what makes the man so funny every time and once again, when this guy came, he sent an assistant to follow him. When the assistant returned, the pharmacist asked him:
- Well, did you follow it? Where did he go?
The assistant responds:
- Home.
- To you!
