The man had an operation, a facelift, leaves the clinic, happy, enjoying life. He approaches the first man he meets and asks:
- Guess how old I am?
He took a closer look and said:
- I think it's about 32 years old.
The man is joyful:
- So you didn't guess, I'm already 46.
He goes into a cafe, approaches a girl and asks:
- Tell me how old I am.
Girl:
- Well, probably 36.
The man:
- And that's not it. I'm 46.
A man is walking down the street, happy, an old woman is standing at the bus stop. He addresses her:
- Guess how old I am.
The old lady says:
- You know, I'm already under 90 and I can't see very well, so I can't determine visually, but if I touch your genitals, I can determine your age by their condition. Here, let me put my hand in your pants and answer without difficulty.
The man became interested and he agreed. The old lady put her hand in his pants, stroked his cock for a few minutes, then says:
- You're 46.
The man is surprised:
- How did you guess that, if it's not a secret?
The old lady smiling:
- And I overheard in the cafe!
