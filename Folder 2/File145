A man came to work with a scratched face and colleagues ask why. He tells me:
- I was walking down the street yesterday, saw a frog in a puddle, put it in my pocket. Do you believe me, guys?
- I brought it home, fed it, watered it. Do you believe me, guys?
- Then, as in a fairy tale, I kissed her and she took and turned into Vasilisa the Beautiful. Do you believe me, guys?
- And my wife didn't believe me yesterday...
