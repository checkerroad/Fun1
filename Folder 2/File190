There is a lonely girl at the disco. Suddenly some big guy comes up to her and starts dancing with her.
She asks:
- Are you a local?
He:
- Yes, a local.
Girl:
- I've never seen you before.
He:
- So I was sitting for a minute!
Girl:
- And for what?
He:
- He killed his wife with an axe!
The girl adjusts her hair and says with a smile:
- So you are not married?
