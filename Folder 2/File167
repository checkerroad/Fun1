In the morning after a stormy night, the Frenchwoman sends her lover:
- Dear, go to the bakery for croissants!
Lover:
- How much to buy?
Frenchwoman:
- As many times as you and I had sex last night.
The lover came to the bakery and told the seller:
- Please sell 10 croissants!
Then, after thinking about it, he says:
- So, stop! Nine croissants and a lollipop!
