Grandma bought galoshes without a box in the store. How to carry it? There is also the first thing that came across on the way, a pharmacy. I decided to ask for a box there. He tells the seller:
- My daughter, please give me some kind of box.
The seller gives her a box without a second thought, with the inscription - 100 condoms.
A grandmother is riding with a box on the bus, and a passenger who saw this picture asks:
- Grandma, how long will this box be enough for you?
The grandmother sighed:
- Yes, as my old man blinks, it's not for a week longer!
