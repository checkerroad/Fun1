Two dukes were courting a charming princess. One was old and decrepit, the other was young and strong. The king decided to arrange a duel between them-a contest at the end of which, it was necessary to swim across a small lake. They jumped into the pond and to the joy of the princess, the young one began to outpace the elderly rival. And to further provoke the young man, the princess threw off her clothes and appeared naked. But suddenly, the young one began to swim slower and slower, and eventually the old one overtook him and won. The annoyed princess runs up to the young man and asks:
- Well, what about you? I had such hopes for you...
Young Duke:
- It's my own fault! I was sure I would win easily until you took off your clothes. That's when I started plowing along the bottom and clinging to the algae!
