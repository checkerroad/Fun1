In the refectory of the Theological Seminary, a sign hangs over a dish with apples:
- Take only one apple. God is watching you!
On the other side of the table there is a large tray with cookies, over which some quick-witted person left a note:
- Take the cookies as much as you like, as long as the Lord is watching the apples.
