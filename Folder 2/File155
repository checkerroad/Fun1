A new teacher comes into the classroom with a huge joint, sits down, fumbles and sits pulling, conducting a dialogue:
- Children, I am your new biology teacher, Peter Sergeevich…
Inhales, exhales:
- Today I will tell you about the sawfish.
He takes a drag, then says carefully:
"This fish lives on the very, very bottom of the ocean, in the eternal darkness.
I grabbed it again:
- But... Sometimes she goes ashore and starts sawing trees.…
He took another bite, thought about it and:
- That's a fucking chickpea fish!
