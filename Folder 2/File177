In the elevator, a maniac attacked a girl, put a knife to her throat and says:
- Now you're going to give me a min%t, then I'm going to kick your ass, then I'm going to throw you off the roof of the house.
The girl says:
- Why in the elevator, you can go to my house, I'll get some pleasure for the last time.
The maniac asks:
- Who's at home? Do you live alone?
The girl says:
- With an old grandfather.
They go to the girl's apartment, and she screams from the doorway:
- Grandpa, some maniac is harassing me.
An old grandfather comes out of the kitchen. Two meters tall, stars are stuffed on his shoulders, with a huge cleaver, grabs a fucking maniac, bends over with cancer, pulls off his pants and tries to insert his hero into him. But he doesn't climb. Grandfather shouts to his granddaughter:
- Bring the blade, we will expand it!
Then the maniac begged:
- Well, don't, please don't! As a dear father, please try again!
