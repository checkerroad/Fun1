Two women at the racetrack. They aim at which horse to bet on.
One and asks:
- What's your bust number?
The second one says:
- The third, and what?
First:
- I have a fourth, and three plus four will make seven. We bet on the horse number 7.
This horse won. We won a decent amount. We came home, bragged to our men. The husbands went to the racetrack themselves the next day. One asks the other:
- How many times do you satisfy your wife during the night?
Second:
- Five!
The first one:
- I'm six! We put it on the 11th.
Horse number 3 won. The men lost all the money.
Yes. Don't kid yourself!
