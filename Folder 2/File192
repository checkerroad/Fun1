The couple stayed at a famous Moscow hotel. In the morning they were paid. The husband, seeing 50 thousand in him, was outraged:
- Where did this amount come from, are you stunned?
The administrator says:
- How for what! You used the sauna, swimming pool, massage services, and Russian pop stars sang to you in our restaurant.
The husband does not stop being indignant:
- What a sauna with a swimming pool, what stars, we didn't leave the room anywhere!
The administrator:
- Well, that's your problem! But we could!
The wife comes up and puts 5 thousand on the reception desk.
Administrator:
- Five? Is there another 45?
His wife:
- I've reduced the amount for belly dancing, striptease, group sex and I've given you a blowjob a couple of times!
Now the administrator is indignant:
- What are you saying? This is the first time I've seen you!
Wife:
- Well, that's your problem! Or you could have used it, I've been here all night!
