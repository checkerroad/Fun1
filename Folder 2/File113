The teacher tells the girls from the class where to study Vovochka?
- Girls, if Vovochka says something indecent in class, then you will get up in protest and leave the classroom.
The lesson is in progress. The teacher asks the question:
- Children, what is new and remarkable to be built in our city?
Children call:
- University, library, cinema, school.
Vovochka answers:
- A brothel.
The girls get up, leave the classroom, and Vovochka follows them:
- Where are you, sluts? The foundation is just being poured!
