The family is having lunch. Father and sons are at the table. Suddenly the father to the eldest:
- Eat the soup properly! What are you doing with a spoon on a plate, it's disgusting to look at!
The son snaps back:
- What are you yelling at?
Father indignantly:
- Who shouted? You asshole!
And he gives his son a slap on the head. The other, the middle son, intercedes:
- Dad, well, if he doesn't want to eat, why force him, and even with a slap on the head? You're a tyrant.
Father to the second son:
- Am I the tyrant? You bastard!
And I'll slap my second son in the ears.
The youngest son put down the spoon and covered his ears with his hands. His father:
- What are you afraid of? You are polite, you are not rude to your father, you eat well, why should you be afraid?
The younger son says,
"Yes, I know. I'm just in case, you never know. You're such an asshole.
