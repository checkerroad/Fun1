A man came to the bathhouse on women's day. Morning, the bathhouse is empty, and he tells the attendant:
- Listen, let's not have anyone yet, I'll wash up quickly.
The attendant gave the go-ahead. The man washed and did not have time. Two women came. The man stood in a corner, it does not shine. The women have started to wash and are talking casually. One says:
- I was in the States in the bathhouse, there are statues in the washroom, I pulled on my dick, and she pulled on your broom, she pulled on your gang again.
Well, a man without thinking twice grabs a broom, a basin and stands like a statue.
The first one says:
- Look, we have the same ones!
One woman came up, pulled once, the man gave her a broom, the man pulled her gang again.
The second one tugged, tugged and said:
- Oh, Ludk, I also squeezed out shampoo!
