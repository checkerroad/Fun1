A call is broadcast to a radio station, a woman is calling:
- Hello. Is this an Autoradio?
DJ in response:
- Hello, I'm listening to you carefully!
The woman is a little excited:
- Today my husband Anatoly and I have an anniversary, and he gave me a gorgeous bouquet of roses and ten thousand for a gift. He's on a flight right now and I want you to play a song for him, about only.
The DJ goes over the options in his head, but does not find them and clarifies with the woman:
- I'm sorry, we don't know what song we're talking about, we can at least say a few words from the text.
Woman:
- Well, of course. This is a very famous song by Sofia Rotaru...
- Only, Only, Only... This is not enough...
