The cabin boy came to the schooner. The seasoned skipper explained to him what and how, where the bunk, locker and galley were... And the cabin boy asks:
- Will the voyage last six months?
The skipper told him:
- That's right, son.
The cabin boy:
- How can you spend so much time without women?
The skipper brought the cabin boy to a small empty cabin, where on one wall there is a life-size drawing of a naked woman with a hole in an intimate place.
- There you go!
The cabin boy is interested:
- Can I try it?
I tried it, I liked it:
- Can I have more?
The Skipper:
- Yes, as much as you want, even every day, but except Friday.
The cabin boy clarifies:
- And why except Friday?
Skipper:
- And on Fridays it's your turn to stand on the other side!
