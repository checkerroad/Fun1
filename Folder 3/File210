Two friends during the trip had to spend the night at the house of a rich widow due to bad weather. After 9 months, one of them receives a letter from the widow's lawyer, and calls a friend:
- Do you remember when we spent the night at the widow's house during the campaign?
The second one responds:
- Yes, I remember.
The first one continues:
- Do you remember how you went to her room several times, and then bragged about how nice you were to her?
The second:
- Yes, I remember.
The first:
- And you, what did you tell her by my name?
The second:
- I'm sorry, my friend, I didn't mean to... She's had a baby and she wants to hold you accountable?
The first:
- No, but you can congratulate me! That widow died the other day and bequeathed me her entire fortune...
