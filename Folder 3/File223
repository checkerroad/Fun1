A little boy and his grandfather were cleaning the yard with a rake from leaves. The boy noticed a worm that was trying to climb back into the ground, but it was not working. Grandson:
- Grandfather, do you want to bet 500 rubles that I will put a worm in the ground?
Grandfather:
- It won't work. He's too soft.
But still, the grandfather argued with his grandson. The grandson ran into the house, brought a bottle of hairspray, straightened the worm, doused the worm with varnish and when the varnish hardened, he easily shoved it into the ground. The grandfather gave his grandson 500 rubles, grabbed the varnish and ran into the house. Half an hour later, the grandmother leaves the house and gives her grandson another 1,000 rubles.
Grandson:
- Grandma, Grandpa has already given the money for the dispute.
Grandma, smiling:
- I know. This is from me personally.
