The girl came to the gynecologist's appointment with her mother. The doctor examined the girl and concluded:
- You are pregnant.
The mother immediately:
- What are you doing! My daughter didn't date anyone, didn't have a boyfriend, she's a virgin!
The doctor goes to the window and looks out in silence. The mother says:
- Doctor, why are you silent?
Doctor:
- They say that at such moments a star rises in the East. Here, I'm watching.
