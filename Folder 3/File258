The husband accosts his wife at night, inclining her to marital duty. The wife excuses herself:
- I'm tired, a hard day at work, cooking, dishes, more washing ...
my husband suggests:
- Let's do it in Brazilian in this case!
The wife, intrigued, agreed. The husband settled down as usual, as usual, finished as quickly as usual, fell on his side and began to snore.
His wife pushes him away:
Honey, it's the same as always, where is Brazil?
Husband in a dream:
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry, I completely forgot... Cha-cha-cha...
