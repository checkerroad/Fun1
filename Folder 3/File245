In the accounting department of a construction company, the director looked in with a question to the accountant:
- Tanyusha, tell me how you feel, is there something missing in your life?
Accountant:
- Viktor Sergeevich, what are you talking about?
Director:
- You wrote the word rubble in the bills without the letter S. With that, four times!
