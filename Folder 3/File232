Angela Merkel died and went to hell. She stands with her suitcases at the gates of hell and cries. The devil comes out and informs her that a mistake has occurred and she needs to go to heaven. Merkel, in joy, having forgotten her suitcases, ran to heaven. The devil calls a few little devils, tells them to take things to heaven and return them to Merkel. The little devils have already reached paradise, the gates have already been closed. They decided to flatter over the fence with all the suitcases. They began to climb over, and at this time in paradise one archangel says to another:
- Well, just look at this! Merkel has been with us for less than an hour, and the refugees are already in full swing!
