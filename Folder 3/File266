The husband tells his wife:
- Let's go to the bedroom.
Wife:
- It won't work. Vovochka is sitting and playing. He's a kid, how do we explain to him what we're going to do in the bedroom?
Husband:
- I'm deciding everything now.
He comes up to Vovochka and says:
- Vovochka, go to the window and watch the people passing by. For every person you see in black, you'll get a ruble.
Vovochka went to the window, the husband and wife retired to the bedroom. Ten minutes later, they hear:
- A ruble...
in another ten minutes:
- Two rubles...
twenty minutes later, Vovochka screams:
- Listen, Dad, a prostitute would have been cheaper for you at times, there was a funeral procession.
