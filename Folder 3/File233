A guy came to the bar and ordered a whiskey:
- How much is it for me?
The bartender:
- Three dollars.
The man takes three coins out of his pocket, puts one dollar on the counter in front of him, goes to the left end of the counter, puts the second dollar there, then goes to the right end of the counter, puts the third one there. The bartender, cursing softly, goes right and left and collects money.
In short, this pattern repeats day after day for a week.
And once again, the man orders whiskey, takes a glass, rummages in his pocket, and this time pulls out a $5 bill. The bartender quickly snatches a bill from the man, smiles maliciously, takes out two dollars in change, goes to the left end of the counter, puts one dollar there, then goes to the right end and there he puts the second one. Then he returns and gloats at the man.
The man calmly finishes his whiskey, pulls out a dollar from his pocket, puts it in front of him:
- Buddy, give me another glass of whiskey.
