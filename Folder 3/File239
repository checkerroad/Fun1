A sad man is sitting in a bar, sadly looking at his glass. A hefty bully barges into the bar, approached the peasant and drained his glass in one gulp without asking. The peasant dropped his head even lower and howled bitterly. The big guy, who did not expect such a turn, already sat down. Then he patted the man on the shoulder:
- Stop being so upset. It's kind of a prank. I'll buy you a drink now.
The man continues to be sad:
- No, you just don't understand. Today is the worst day of my life!
- At first I overslept for work. I came to the office and I was fired. I went outside and found that my car had been stolen. The police told me that they were unlikely to help. I took a taxi home. I forgot my briefcase with all my documents and money in the taxi, and the scoundrel taxi driver took off. At home, I found my wife in bed with her lover. My wife informed me that I couldn't do shit in bed, and kicked me out. I go to a bar, get drunk, and when I decide to leave this broken life, then you fly up and drink my glass of poison!
