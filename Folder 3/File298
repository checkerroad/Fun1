The optometrist informs the patient:
- I have two pieces of news for you. One is good, the other is bad. Which one should I start with?
Patient:
- With a good one.
The doctor told him:
- Soon you will be able to read without glasses.
Patient:
- How am I going to read without glasses, if I almost can't see with glasses?
The DOCTOR:
- The second news. With your fingers, my dear, with your fingers.
