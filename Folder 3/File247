The husband and wife agreed that if anyone wants to talk, then:
- I have an ace.
And if you don't want to:
- I have a six.
We went to bed, my husband said:
- And I have an ace.
His wife answers him:
- And I have a six.
The husband was offended and turned away to the wall. After a while, the wife fidgeted:
- And I have an ace...
her husband:
- And I have a six!
The wife throws back the blanket from her husband and is indignant:
- What kind of six? The most important ace!
Husband:
- It's not nice to look at other people's cards!
