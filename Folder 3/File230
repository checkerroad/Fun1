At the beginning of the 19th century, most of the students in our universities studied French and we pushed Bonaparte and took Paris.
At the beginning of the 20th century, most students in our universities studied German. We beat Hitler and took Berlin.
It is now the beginning of the 21st century and most students in our universities are studying English. I tell you, there has never been such a rich choice in our history.
