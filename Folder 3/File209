A Russian and an American argued over who had more holidays. For every holiday – click.
American:
- Independence Day, Christmas, Easter…
Ten and a half times, Shchelbanov punched the Russian and substitutes his forehead, in the joyful hope of getting off with less. Rusky crunched his fingers and began:
- New Year, Christmas, February 23, March 8, May 1, May 9, November 7, etc.
Consciousness is slowly starting to come out of the American. Rusky continues to beat the snaps:
- Radio Day, Border Guard Day, Fisherman's Day, Sailor's Day, for Airborne Forces, Builder's Day, Tanker's Day, Teacher's Day, Driver's Day...
The American fell senseless, and the Russian kicked him in the ribs:
- Advance, Payday, Advance with %ka, Payday, Advance, Payday!
