A girl married a village guy. A couple of days later, the father-in-law wakes up early and sees that the daughter-in-law is walking in the yard, cleaning, washing. He asks:
- Why can't you sleep?
She answers:
- Yes, it's boring.
Father-in-law gives instructions to his son:
- Are you a man or not? She's bored, so you're not coping with your marital responsibilities.
The son immediately took his wife into the bedroom and fucked her unconscious. After a couple of days, history repeats itself. A week later, her mother came from the city to visit. We sat and chatted. The daughter asks:
- How are you doing, Mom?
The mother answers:
- Yes, more or less, it's just boring.
Here the daughter abruptly closes her mother's mouth with her palm and says:
- Mom, you can't say the word boring in this house, otherwise they gasp until they lose consciousness.
