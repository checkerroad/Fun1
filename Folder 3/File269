The husband and wife went to bed. Vovochka is in the crib next to me. A little time has passed, the husband says to his wife:
- Darling, give me a hug.
Wife:
- Wait a bit, my son will fall asleep now.
A little more time passes, the husband again:
- Darling, hug me.
Wife:
- Yes, you wait, my son will fall asleep now.
The husband, offended, went to the kitchen to drink a glass of champagne, opens the bottle. There is a pop, champagne spills on the floor, the man slips and crashes to the floor. The son in the crib raises his head and says to his mother:
- I was stubborn that my father shot himself!
