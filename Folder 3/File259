A surgeon is being tried for raping a cleaning lady. The judge asks the surgeon:
- You are a well-known, respected doctor! What do you allow yourself?
Surgeon:
- I haven't been out of the operating room for three days. During this time, I only slept for two hours. I needed a release, I saw that the cleaner was bent over, so I couldn't help myself. By the way, she didn't resist.
The judge addresses the injured party:
- The victim, tell us how it was?
Cleaning lady:
I washed the floor on the first floor, I washed it on the second floor. I came on the third, bent down, wrung out a rag and suddenly he entered me.
Judge:
- Well, why didn't you run away?
The cleaner:
- Where to run to? On the soaped floor?
