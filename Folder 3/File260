- Now I will never hear his footsteps and the doorbell ring at exactly seven o'clock in the evening!
- God, what happened, girlfriend?
- And there will never be a twilight in the living room for him again...
- Come on...
- He will no longer sit in the evenings and call me gentle words, as he has been doing for all these two years! And tonight I'm going to burn all his love letters!
- Girlfriend, are you going to break up with him?
- Break up? Well no. I'm marrying him!
