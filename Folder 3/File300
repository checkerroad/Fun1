The man was bitten by a dog and feeling unimportant, he went to the doctor. The doctor examined him and said:
- I must disappoint you, you have rabies.
The man took a piece of paper and began to write something quickly.
The doctor is trying to stop him:
- Why are you writing a will? I will cure you.
The man answers when he's finished:
- This is not a will. This is a list of people I need to bite before you cure me.
