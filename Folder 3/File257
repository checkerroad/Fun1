An old woman who sold radishes at the subway for 10 rubles per bunch is approached every day by the same guy, leaves her a tenner, but does not take a radish. One day, when he once again gave his grandmother a tenner, she grabs his hand. The guy tells her:
- Are you wondering why I leave you money, but I don't take anything?
Grandma doesn't care:
- I'm not interested at all. Starting today, radishes cost 15 rubles.
