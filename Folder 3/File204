My son is going on a bear hunt. The old father, a legless invalid, asks to take him with him. The son is at a loss:
- Well, where are you going, dad, without legs?
Father:
- You put me in a backpack, and if I help you to bring down a bear, suddenly your rifle will fail, you will turn me around, then I will go...
Son:
- Well, okay, okay. Maybe it will really help at the right moment.
They came to the den, stirred it up, and a hefty bear jumped out from there. He raises his gun, misses, then misfires. He turns around and Dad is a doublet into the void. They run, but the bear is already on their heels. The son thinks:
- You can't run away together, it's a pity for dad, but you'll have to leave, why should two die?
I dropped my backpack, but I ran three times faster! He runs into the house, can't catch his breath, and his mother comes towards him. Son taking a deep breath:
- That's it, Mother, we don't have a father anymore!
Mother:
"You hunters don't get it. My father crawled in five minutes ago. He says we don't have a son anymore!
