The wife and her lover are lying in bed. The phone rings. The wife picks up the phone, her husband's voice comes out of the receiver:
- Honey, what are you doing? I've missed you!
Wife:
- I'm waiting for you, dear! I missed you so much too, so much!
Husband:
- I'll meet you in the morning, sweetheart. I would have rushed to you now, but Ivan Ivanovich and I are compiling a report on the work of the trust over the past fifty years. I can't do it before morning.
Wife:
- Don't overload yourself too much! I kiss you, I look forward to meeting you!
The lover asks:
- Did hubby call?
His wife:
- That's the one. He won't be back until morning. He's been compiling a report with you on the work of the trust for the last fifty years.
