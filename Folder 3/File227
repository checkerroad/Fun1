A guy is in a night bar and ordered a mug of first-class beer. The bartender says,
"That'll be one penny."
The man looked at the mug, took another sip of beer and asked the bartender again:
- How much, how much? Is there only one penny for such a mug of excellent beer? Well, then 200 cognac, a large steak and pineapple!
Bartender:
- Along with the beer, all this will cost you four kopecks.
Guy:
- Who is the owner of this wonderful place?
The bartender:
- You can meet him, he's upstairs with my wife right now.
Guy:
- What is he doing there with your wife?
The bartender:
"The same thing I'm doing here with his business right now.
