The wife of the new Russian suspected that her husband was cheating on her with a maid. In the evening, she sent the maid to the city, and she went to sleep in her room.
Soon, the door quietly opened and a man entered. Without turning on the light, he undressed and passionately began to please his wife. As soon as he finished, she jumped up, turned on the light and screamed:
- Well, parasite, here you are! Surprised?
That's all the gardener could say:
- Oh, very much.
