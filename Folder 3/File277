How my parents taught me to be independent. I come home and see a note:
- Sausages are on the table.
Next time:
- Sausages in a saucepan on the stove, heat them up.
After a while:
- Sausages are in the fridge. Cook it.
Further:
- Sausages in the store, money on the table. Go, buy, cook.
At the end of the training, a note with the following content:
- Sausages in the store. Money at work.
