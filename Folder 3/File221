Two Russian oligarchs, sitting in their residence on the Cote d'Azur, celebrate May 9th. They remembered how the grandfathers fought, drank Provencal wine to the victory, ate excellent cheese, savored, admired the taste and one of them said:
"It's good that the grandfathers did not reach France, otherwise they would be drinking some kind of "Monk's Whisper" and snacking on "Poshekhonsky"...
