Three very drunk guys get into a taxi. The driver noticed that they were drunk and decided to deceive them. He started the engine, jerked five meters and stopped. He turns to the passengers and says:
- We are all in place, I will ask you to pay off.
The first guy thanked him, the second handed him the payment, and the third slapped the taxi driver on the back of the head.
The taxi driver asked:
- For what?
The guy answers:
- It was not a horseradish to drive at such a speed! You almost killed us all! Fucking Schumacher!
