Peter the Great returned from Holland, gathered the Duma and told the boyars:
- Boyars, port wine was invented in Holland!
All:
- What is port wine?
Peter the Great:
- Well, it's like vodka, only tastier and easier to drink.
All boyars:
- We want port wine!
Peter the Great:
- So the boyars, that's not all. The Dutch also invented the condom.
All:
- What is a condom?
Peter the Great:
- This is such a gut so that you can have fun with a woman and women don't get pregnant.
All:
- We want a condom!
Peter the Great:
- Boyars, there is only money in the treasury for one invention, and for this the Dutch invented voting!
An old boyar gets up and says:
- That's right, Pyotr Alekseevich, as they poked naked, so we will poke, and we want port wine!
