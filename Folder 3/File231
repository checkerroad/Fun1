The guy is chatting on Skype with his ex. She told him:
- Have you quit smoking?
Guy:
- yes. I almost don't smoke for a year.
The former:
- Are you drinking?
Guy:
- No. It's not interesting.
The former:
- Did you quit fucking?
Guy:
- No, you didn't quit fucking.
Ex-teasing:
- I was just thinking of giving you a rubber woman!
Guy:
- No, no, no... Don't come back to me!
