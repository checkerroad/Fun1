A husband and wife live in a studio apartment with their five-year-old son. The husband wanted a wife, but pale, the son is at home. In the end, the father tells the son:
- Son, let's watch from the window and tell everything that happens in the yard, but don't turn around. Agreed?
The son goes to the window and begins to tell his father everything he sees, and meanwhile the father begins to use his wife.
Son:
- Uncle Vanya is planting a tree in the yard. Aunt Sveta is coming back from work. The Petrovs are cleaning the carpet. Kolkin's dad is fucking mom %t.
My father almost fell off the couch. He asks his son:
- What makes you think that?
Son:
- So Kolka is also looking out the window!
