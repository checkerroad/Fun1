The turner thoughtfully wipes the wrench with a cloth. The boss comes up to him and starts throwing:
- Petrov, your mother! Why the fuck are you going home so early? The time is still 17:00
Petrov:
- The point is as follows... I'll wipe the key with a cloth while I clean the machine with an iron brush, while I wash the handles with soap, while I change my clothes, and just the end of the working day will come.
His boss:
- No, it's not right! Here I am getting ready from work at exactly 18:00!
Petrov:
- Why do you need to pack? The fuck closed and went.
