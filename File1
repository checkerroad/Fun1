There was a blind girl who felt that her parents were depriving her all the time. She didn't give in to any persuasions from mom and dad that she was the one and only, that everything was for her.
Parents finally got tired of this, they cooked a pelvis of dumplings so that she would make sure that there was nothing to be sorry for her beloved child, the girl sat down at the table, runs her hands over the dumplings and says:
- I can imagine how much you've done to yourself.
