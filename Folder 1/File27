The middle of the seventies of the last century. Three men on a business trip, sitting at night in a hotel drinking and baiting political jokes. One decided to prank two of his colleagues. Tells them:
- We are poisoning political jokes in vain, in all hotels, wiretaps from the KGB are installed in the rooms, in the sockets.
The other two:
- Come on, stop being creepy.
The guy who decided to make a joke went out into the corridor under the guise of making a phone call, approached the maid and said:
- Please bring three teas to our room in ten minutes.
I returned to the room, they continue to harass jokes about Brezhnev.
The joker leaned over to the outlet and said:
- Comrade Major, please give us three teas!
After a couple of minutes, the maid comes and brings three teas.
The other two men exchanged glances with each
other...
We laughed and continued the vodka stories...
In the morning, the joker wakes up, the maid cleans the floor and there is no one else. He asks:
- Have you seen where my colleagues are?
The maid answers:
- So they were taken away at five in the morning.
The man is not much at a loss:
- How was they taken away, who took them away, and why wasn't I taken away?
The maid replies,
"And Comrade Major liked your joke!
