Two friends meet. One says to the other:
- Look at what kind of binoculars I bought for myself, fancy, Japanese.
The second:
- Well, I'll take a look... What an ordinary Japanese guy he is... Chinese consumer goods.
The first one:
- You are awesome, consumer goods... Yesterday at half past seven in the evening I looked through it into your window and clearly saw you talking to your wife. Well, what do you say to that?
Second:
- That's the proof of that... Of course it's consumer goods, otherwise you'd see that it's your wife.
