At the medical institute, at a lecture on sexology, a teacher:
- So young people, who knows how many poses to have sex?
From somewhere in Kamchatka, a man's voice:
- Fifty!
The ash giver:
- Yes, it is clear that everyone knows the back rows, but we will ask, for example, the girl from the first row. The girl says, embarrassed:
- I know one.
Teacher:
"Which one is it?"
The girl blushing:
- A woman is lying on her back with her legs spread, a man is lying on top of her
A voice from the back rows:
- Fifty-one!
