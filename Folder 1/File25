The wife buries her husband, stands in front of the coffin in the cemetery and wails:
- I would kiss my hands, but I didn't see the pay...
- I would kiss my eyes, but I didn't see the affection...
- I would kiss my heels, but I walked around without looking back...
My father approaches the widow and whispers:
- Come on, kiss the bump, and close the lid...
