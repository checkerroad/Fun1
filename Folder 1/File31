Two bears sleep in a den in winter. One wakes up, wakes up the other and says:
- Listen, I want a bear, my jaw is cramping.
The second bear responds:
- Where can I get a bear? Winter is in the yard, the two of us sleep in the den for the second month. Go to sleep!
The first bear:
- I can't sleep now until I get the bear.
The second bear:
- Well, let me help you out in a friendly way, well, this is the case ...
the first bear indignantly:
- Are you fucked up? And who will find out. They will stop being afraid, they will not say hello. Shame on the whole forest! Rot away!
The second bear:
- Who's going to know? The two of us are lying in a den littered with snow, it's almost night.
The bear agreed and joined the second one from behind. But by chance a hare ran through the forest and fell into the den of the bears, sat on his ass and fucked up from what he saw.
The bear is on the hare, the hare is off it. They are running through the forest. They come running to the river, the bear almost caught up with the big-eared one, stretched, and the hare dived into the ice hole. The bear immediately followed the hare into the ice hole, grabbed the hand of the bully, pulled it out - the beaver. The beaver spread its claws at the bear:
- Get your hands off me, pid@ryuga!
