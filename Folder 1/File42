Premiere at the theater. The audience is sitting, waiting for the performance. The lights go out. Suddenly, in complete darkness, a man comes on stage with a chair, holding a lighted candle in his hands. He puts a chair in the middle of the stage, lowers his pants, sits down on a chair and starts jerking off.
After five minutes, one of the spectators can't stand watching and coughs loudly twice.
The man on the stage sharply blows on the candle:
- Who's here?
