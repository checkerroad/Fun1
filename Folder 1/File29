A businessman rushes along the highway on his six hundred at 200 km/ h and at the entrance to the city a traffic policeman, with a waving baton, jumps out right in front of the car itself. The businessman did not have time to react and knocks him down on a silencer. And there is a cemetery not far away. Well, that there are no witnesses, the ends need to be cut off. He dragged the traffic policeman into the trunk, arrived at the cemetery, went into the gatehouse and told the grandfather-watchman:
- Grandfather, here's a bottle of vodka in my trunk, a traffic cop, you should bury it ...
Grandfather waved 150 grams:
- Yes, it's easy.
A businessman jumped out of the cemetery, just accelerated, another traffic cop slammed and went back to the glushnyak. That's not the task. He put it in the trunk again, back to his grandfather at the cemetery:
- Grandpa, what the hell is this? I think you buried Gaitz, and he's back in my trunk.
Grandfather waved another 150 white-eyed:
- Miracles... Okay, lad, I'll do it all right now.
They dragged the traffic cop out of the trunk, the businessman left the cemetery, the grandfather buried the second guy, came to the gatehouse, finished the bottle and fell drunk into bed.
And not far from the cemetery, another squad of traffic cops is on duty in ambush... One to the other:
- Something is suspicious, the gelding has been spinning in the cemetery for the six hundredth half of the night, back and forth, let's go and see what kind of nonsense is there.
We drove up to the gatehouse. One traffic cop comes inside, wakes up a drunken grandfather and asks:
- Grandfather, what is going on here?
The grandfather wakes up, gets up stiff, takes a shovel, swings and says:
- Will you bitch calm down today?
