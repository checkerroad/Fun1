A whole gang is operating at the grocery store in Leningradka. The scheme is very simple. You go shopping to the car, not far from you, two pretty slender girls are moving in the same direction. You walk up to the car, they turn out to be next to each other. You put your purchases in the trunk, get in the car. The girls start to wipe your windshield, of course, you take out your wallet to give them money. But they refuse, they say:
- Better take us to Moscow, please.
You answer them:
- Well, sit down.
One sits forward, the other sits back. Suddenly, the one sitting in the front seat unbuttons your fly and starts doing min%t, and the second one at this time, slowly pulls out your wallet. Be careful! My wallet was stolen last week, and it will be stolen yesterday and tomorrow.
