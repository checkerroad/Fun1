The family is inspecting the new apartment. They figure out what kind of furniture and where to put it. A five-year-old child says:
- And here we take the shelf for%.
His father slaps him on the back of the head:
- Do you understand why?
Child:
- Yes, I understand!
Father:
- What did you understand?
Kid:
- She didn't fall by x% here.
