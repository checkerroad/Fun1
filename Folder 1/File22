At school, everyone bullied the boy because he had a head like a... dad.
He comes home every time after school, roars at the explosion. His mother calms him down:
- Don't cry, the guys are just teasing you, you have a normal head.
The boy calmed down and went for a walk. He walks down the street, sees an open hatch, looks into it.
The repairman shouts from the hatch:
- Here cf...You can't!
