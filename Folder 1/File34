The chairman holds a meeting at his collective farm:
- The average increase in meat in our collective farm is 100 kg per day.
An employee stands up and says to the chairman:
- Listen, Petrovich... Where does 100 come from? I have 100 in my brigade, and Tanya has 20 in her brigade!
Petrovich:
- Well, it's on average.
The Chairman continues:
- The average milk yield per day is 200 liters.
The same employee gets up again and says to the chairman:
- Listen, Petrovich... Where did 200 come from? I have 200 in my brigade, and Tanya has 70 in her brigade!
Petrovich:
- Well, it's on average.
Still the same employee.:
- Listen, Petrovich... So I've lived with one husband all my life, and Tanya gets three men a night...
- So on average I'm fucking!
