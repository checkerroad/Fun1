Two sharks swim, young and old, they see a diver.
The young one says to the old one:
- Uh, let's have a quick lunch now.
The old one says:
- Take your time. Now we'll do a couple of laps around the diver and go deep for a short time.
- In a couple of minutes, a couple of laps again and we'll be out of sight.
- Well, then you can eat.
The young one asks:
- Why such difficulties?
The old one answers:
- Are you going to eat it with all the g...in it?
