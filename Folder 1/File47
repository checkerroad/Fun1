MAZ drove into the ass of the six hundredth Mercedes. The brothers get out of the Merc, knead their brushes, and a hefty two-meter tall bully gets out of the MAZ and how let's sweep the brothers left, right. I put everyone down, got into my MAZ and drove on.
One brother wakes up, slows down the second and asks:
- Did you remember the numbers?
The second one replied:
- I remember. 50 50.
The first one again:
And the letters?
The second:
- Yes, there were no letters on the soles.
