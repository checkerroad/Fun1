Two o'clock in the morning. A noisy drunken campaign to the fullest, walking in his friend's apartment. The neighbors couldn't stand it and called the police. The outfit has arrived and is ringing the doorbell to the vacationers. The guy who owns the apartment opens the door and asks:
- Gentlemen of the police, what do you want? We didn't call the police! Prostitutes were called, but the police were not!
Police officers:
- It was your neighbors who called us!
Guy:
- So let my neighbors listen to you and tr@ha, and the boys and I will wait for prostitutes!
