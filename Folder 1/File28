A boy and a girl are playing in the sandbox and let's brag to each other
Boy:
- And I have this tank.
Girl:
- And I have this doll.
The boy:
- And I have these soldiers.
Girl:
- And I have this kind of stroller.
The boy takes off his pants and shows his pussy:
- And I have this!
The girl was confused, she did not have such a thing, burst into tears of resentment and ran home to complain to her mother.
The next day, the same story again...
the boy:
- And I have this gun.
Girl:
- And I have this kind of jump rope.
Boy:
- And I have this scooter.
Girl:
- And I have this ball.
The boy takes off his pants again and shows his pussy:
- And I have this!
Girl:
- And my mother told me when I grow up, I will have a hundred of them!
