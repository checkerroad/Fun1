Three friends are talking. One says:
- Girls, I'm afraid to sleep! I will dream about a rapist, so the next day I will definitely be raped!
The second:
- And I have the same bullshit! The rapist caught me in a dream, and the next day I was raped in a dark alley!
Third:
- Girls, which side to sleep on?
