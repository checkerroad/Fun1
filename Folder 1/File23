Grandfather Mazai comes to the Germans at the commandant's office and asks the commandant:
- Give me back my hares!
The commandant replied:
- Write, grandfather, where the partisans are and how many, then we will give you your hares.
Grandfather walked, thought, thought... It's not right to betray your own, but it's too bad for hares. He surrendered all the partisans with cartridges, the Germans destroyed the entire detachment. The next day, the grandfather comes to the commandant and demands:
- I have fulfilled your conditions, as it were, give the hares.
The commandant:
- Yes, three days ago they ate all your hares. Go, grandfather, for good health.
Grandfather Mazai goes home and thinks:
- And I didn't save the hares, and it turned out to be awkward with the guys...
