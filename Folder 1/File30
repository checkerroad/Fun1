A new teacher came to class. I introduced myself to the children and got to know the students by listing them in the magazine:
- Petrov.
Petrov stands up.
The teacher:
- Hello, have a seat.
- Ivanov.
Ivanov stands up.
- Hello, have a seat.
- Sidorov.
Sidorov gets up.
- Hello, have a seat.
Then she hesitated a little:
I'm sorry, maybe I'm not naming my last name correctly, but this is what it says in the magazine:
- Fuck.
The student stands up and says:
- You said it right. My last name is really Huev, I am a Bulgarian by nationality, in Bulgaria it is a fairly common surname.
The teacher tilted her head and looked at the student from under her glasses:
- Well, sit down, Bulgarian huev.
