A boy from Odessa from a Jewish family asks his aunt:
- Aunt Sarah, what does your neighbor Cilia do?
The aunt answers:
- I don't even know... She doesn't work, but Georgians, Armenians, and Uzbeks come to her every dayâ€¦
Boy:
- Oh, is she still a prostitute?
Aunt Sarah:
- Well, you're Fima, I'm begging you! Prostitutes are the ones who ruined our country, and the girl collects it as best she can!
