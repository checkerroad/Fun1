A husband with a hangover asks his wife:
- Give me a ticket from the head, otherwise it's splitting!
Wife:
- Take it from my purse!
The husband swallowed a handful of pills and went to work. In the evening he returns, his wife says:
- Are you completely stunned? He ate all my birth control pills!
Husband:
- And then I think, why is the boss at work %bet-%bet, %bet-%bet, and at least I don't give a fuck...
