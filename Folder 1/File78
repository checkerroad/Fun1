Two married friends are chatting. I've been married for a long time, everyone's sex is boring and monotonous and one says the other:
- The other day I bought Youth soap in the store, my husband and I washed with this soap and as a result, rough sex all night, as in our youth. Try it, I recommend it.
They meet a couple of days later, the first one asks:
- Well? Have you tried it?
Second friend, tell me:
- I tried it. However, there was no Youth, I bought Baby soap. The children washed up.
First:
- And how?
The second:
- Yes, how... my husband sucked his tit all night, and in the morning he pooped himself...
