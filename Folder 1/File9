An adult son comes to his father with a sad face...
the father asks:
- What happened?
The son answers:
- Yes, my friend got pregnant from me, but we don't want to get married and have children yet. We thought about it and decided. She went and had an abortion. Let's have a drink, Dad, because the mood is kind of disgusting, as if he killed his son.
And how they pushed vodka, so much so that the house burned down.
They are standing near the ashes, the father wipes his face from the soot and says:
- Well, son, now you have one option left...
- to cut down the tree.
