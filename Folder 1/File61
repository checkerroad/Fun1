The man decided to get married. But I didn't know which of the three girls to choose. Then he gave each of them a certain amount of money to see how each would dispose of them. The first one bought expensive clothes for herself with all the money, went to the salon, did her hair, came to the man and said:
- Look dear, I want you to have the most beautiful wife and you can be proud of me!
The second one bought expensive clothes for the man with all the money, furnished the whole house, came to the man and said:
- I want you to be the most beautiful I have and everyone can see what a good hostess I am!
The third invested all the money in the business, a month later she received three times more and took them to the man:
- Look how I take care of your capital!
I thought and thought and chose the one with bigger tits.
