The wife came to the prison camp to meet her husband. After the date, the wife goes to the head of the camp and says:
- You see, my husband is already in years, I want to ask you not to burden him with hard work.
The head of the camp says:
- Yes, their brigade does almost nothing at all. They work half the day, they stick stamps on envelopes.
The wife says:
- It's weird... And he told me that they were building some kind of tunnel at night.
