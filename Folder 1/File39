A Lexus stops at an intersection in front of a traffic light. Light, rhythmic music can be heard from the slightly open window, and a young, pleasant girl of about twenty-eight is driving.
In parallel, a tinted, "kid's eight" with young men of mischievous age stopped in the next lane. They looked at the girl in the Lexus, one of them:
- Look, guys, I pumped up the Lexus!
The girl heard what was said, opened the window and tells them:
- Apologized quickly!
Guys to a girl:
- And what about it?
Girl:
- I'll call my husband, the guys will come... You're getting on a plane!
