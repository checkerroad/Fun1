A new teacher has come to class:
- Hello students! I am your new teacher of Russian and literature, my name is Ivan Vasilyevich. I will try to convey to you all the wonderful things that exist in our great Russian language. We will try to understand Pushkin's high style, Griboyedov's subtle humor, and appreciate the deep meaning of Gogol's works...
- And to the fraers who are cormorating and swearing at the back of the desks, I want to immediately show that for all the misunderstandings I will fuck with a ruler on a hook, and if they don't suck the topic off the cuff, then they will have a serious swing on the carpet at the plowman of the school.
