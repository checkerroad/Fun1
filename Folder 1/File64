A man gets up in the morning with a hangover, looks for slippers for a long time, barely moving his legs, goes to the kitchen. He walks past the cage with the parrot, takes off the cape from the cage, goes into the kitchen, takes a bottle of beer out of the refrigerator, drinks slowly with pleasure and goes back. Passing by the cage with the parrot, he closes it with a cape and goes back to sleep on the sofa. The parrot's voice from the cage:
- Oh, my day has passed today!
