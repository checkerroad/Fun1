There is a ball in the palace. Natasha is dancing with Bolkonsky. Bolkonsky tells her:
- Natasha, someone played a joke on you... You have a vulgar word written on your back.
Natasha:
- So tell me what?
Bolkonsky:
- I can't say such words out loud.
Natasha:
- You're not a man!
Bolkonsky leaves the ball all broken up.
Pierre Bezukhov invited Natasha to dance, they dance and Pierre says:
- Natasha, you don't have a decent word written on your back.
Natasha:
"So tell me, Pierre, what is the word?"
Pierre:
- I'm sorry, I can't! It's not a very decent word!
Natasha:
- Leave me alone. You're a mumbler, sir!
Pierre, curtsying, moves out of sight.
Lieutenant Rzhevsky is dancing with Natasha.
Natasha:
- Lieutenant, well, I hope you tell me what is written on my back.
Rzhevsky looked at the word, smiled and said:
- In order not to be vulgar again, let me spell it out, and you'll guess for yourself.
Natasha:
- All right, Lieutenant, I agree.
Rzhevsky:
- The first letter in this word is the second letter in the word EAR.
- The second letter in this word is the first letter in the word EAR.
- And the third letter in this word is the last letter in the word X...Y
