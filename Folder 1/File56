A phlegmatic lady came to the clinic and complains to the doctor:
- Doctor, I can't stand it anymore... This big city, these people, these cars back and forth, back and forth. Annoying!
The doctor tells her:
- Go outside the city to nature!
She told him :
- Yes, I was in your nature. There's wind and trees, back and forth, back and forth. Annoying!
The DOCTOR:
- Well, relax in a calm environment, have sex, for example. Have you tried it?
Girl:
- No, I haven't tried it.
Doctor
- Well, I suggest you try it right now!
The doctor took the girl behind the screen, put her on the couch, and started.
She told him:
- Doctor, you're either there or here! And then back and forth back and forth. It's so annoying!
