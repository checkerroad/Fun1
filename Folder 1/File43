A Ukrainian guy writes a letter home from the army:
- Hello mom and Dad, I serve normally, I cope, but I really miss our garden. It has such ripe, liquid apples.
- Please send me a parcel with apples, and put a small piece of bacon in the corner of the parcel.
- And if the lard doesn't fit into the package...
- Throw these apples away!
