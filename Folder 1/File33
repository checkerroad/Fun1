Two hunters are walking through the forest, they see a bear in a raspberry bush. One to the other:
- Let's bet I'll hit a bear in the left egg from here!
The second one says:
- Come on!
Shot... Right into the left egg. The bear roared and got really angry at the hunters. They're from him. They run through the forest and feel they will not run away from a wounded bear. We climbed a tall pine tree to the very top. The bear is climbing up to them. The first hunter to the second:
- If you want, I'll shoot the bear's right egg now.
The second hunter yells at the first one:
- Shoot the bear in the head, he's not fucking climbing.
