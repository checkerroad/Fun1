There is a performance in the circus.
The entertainer announces the number:
- Great acrobats are performing!
Acrobats perform, suddenly a man shouts from the audience:
- Look, they're wearing tights, it's a pid...Races!
The entertainer announces the second number:
- Famous clowns are performing!
The clowns perform, the man's shout from the audience again:
- Look at their lips, it's a pid...Races!
The entertainer announces the next number:
- And now a deadly number! Jump from under the dome of the circus!
Another shout from the audience:
- Where are you taking the pid?..Races!?
