Mid-December. In a one-room Khrushchev room with stripped wallpaper, an unknown actor Ostroumov lies on an old, torn sofa. My wife is gone, there is no job, no money. the new year is coming soon. How to celebrate is not yet clear.
Suddenly the phone rings. Ostroumov picks up the phone, and there:
- Hello. Mr. Witty?
The actor responds:
- Yes, it's me.
On the other end of the line:
- Mr. Ostroumov, you are being disturbed from Hollywood. We would like to offer you a supporting role in our film. Schwarzenegger plays the main role, but your role is also voluminous and quite significant.
- Now for the payment... of course we won't pay $3000, but you can count on $2500 per shooting day.
- Hello? Do you agree?
Witty:
- And when is the shooting?
On the other end of the line:
- From December 27 to January 10.
Witty:
- Nah, I can't. I have Christmas Trees!
