My husband bought a book of the Kama Sutra. He and his wife are watching, studying, the husband says:
- Well, that's it, it won't work out together!
Wife:
- And what should I do?
Husband:
Yes, I know a plumber Petrovich, anyway, as usual, he doesn't do shit, I'll go call him.
Wife:
- Call me.
The three of them started a kama Sutra orgy... first position, fifth, twentieth... As soon as they warmed up, Petrovich gets up and leaves.
The husband followed him, stopped him and asked:
- What are you doing? We just warmed up, and you ruined the whole process.
Petrovich:
Come on, your Kama Sutra. The twentieth position is all x...y sosu.
