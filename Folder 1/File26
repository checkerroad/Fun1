The guy wanted to buy an iPhone. For three months, he put his pay in the stash, denied himself food, entertainment, everything. I've finally saved up and realized my dream. I put my phone in my back pocket and forgot. I came home and sat down on a chair, there was a sharp crunch.
A man with a cold sweat on his forehead:
Fuck, if only his spine!
