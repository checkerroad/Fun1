The KAMAZ driver returns to the base, all upset. He goes into the control room and wails:
- Well, the fucking Zaporozhets!
The other drivers surrounded him, interested, and he didn't stop;
He's just:
- Well, the fucking Zaporozhets!
The drivers attacked him, saying let's calm down, explain. He tells me:
- I'm going loaded to the brim today, the engine does not pull out at all on the rise. Well, no way. Two hours back and forth. This Lock stopped nearby, some chukhan gets out and tells me:
- Let me pull it up.
I say:
- Are you a moron or something? The Zaporozhets are full of KAMAZ.
He's still like this to me:
- I'll just pull it out.
Well, I told him:
- If the KAMAZ moves uphill with its Lock, I will suck it off.
The drivers chorused:
- Well...
that one to them:
- Well, the fucking Zaporozhets!
