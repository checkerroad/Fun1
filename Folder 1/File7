A man came to visit a neighbor, and he finished the repair the other day. The man liked the wallpaper in the living room and decided to paste the same wallpaper in the living room at home.
Since the apartments are the same both in layout and in meters, he asks his neighbor:
- How many rolls did you buy for the living room?
The neighbor responds:
- Fifteen.
The guy bought fifteen rolls, pasted wallpaper in the living room, but he had five rolls left.
He comes to a neighbor and says:
- Listen, our apartments are exactly the same, I bought fifteen rolls, glued them, but for some reason I have five rolls left...
the neighbor says:
- Don't worry. I also have five left.
