The orbiter stops the match and assigns a penalty. A defender is running towards him:
- Are you fucking blind?
Orbiter looks at his notebook and sees that this player already has a yellow card, but decided to feel sorry for him, not to delete it. He kindly asks the player:
- Did I hear you or did you say something?
Player:
- So you're still fucking deaf!
